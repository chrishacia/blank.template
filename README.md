blank.template
==============

This is just a starter HTML template for my own needs, containing various script libraries, css libraries, and some of my own custom additions. Admittedly I just don't like repeating the basic stuff, or going on a hunt for the latest copies of stuff every time I have a new idea. Suggestions are welcome.
