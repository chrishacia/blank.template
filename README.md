blank_template
==============

Trying to describe this as loosely as I can. This is my own rendition of a php driven micro framework. To put it as short and sweetly as I can. This is primarily a collection of JavaScript libraries and plugins that I find myself reusing on various projects / ideas. Thrown together in a simple html5 based template that I can easily append/alter. It is also a collection of CSS I have used over time, and general php functions I have written over time. All in all this whole project is something that is widely open to interpretation. I use it often, I refine it as I go. And I offer it up to those who just need a super simple starting point for there own projects. That don't have the overhead most other frameworks have. I would like to eventual roll this into very small micro MVC, but for now this works. 
You are all welcome to use it freely as you wish, if you like it, it helps? Throw me some credit. I am also always open for suggestions / contributions. If anyone wants to enhance it. In fact if you do, I ask that you please throw them into here via pull request. 

Basic HTML5 Boiler Plate Template, that includes a wide variety of JavaScript/CSS preloaded. Bootstrap, Backbone, jQuery to name a few. Coupled with repurpose-able functions I have written in JavaScript and PHP.
